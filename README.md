## Getting Started

### If You're a Programmer... 
1. Download and unzip a copy of the code.
2. If you do not have python already installed on your computer, install a compatible version via https://www.python.org/downloads/.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the unzipped python code: `cd Downloads/data-analysis-of-sales-main/`.
4. Create a virtual environment by running `python -m  venv venv`.
5. Activate your virtual environment.

    a. On Windows run: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.

    b. On Linux run: `source venv/bin/activate`.

6. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages necessary to run the code.
7. Run `python ./main.py` and go through the data analytics displayed.

### If You're a Non-Programmer...
a. If you want to just view the code and its associated output, click on the `main.ipynb` file listed above.

b. Otherwise, if you want to run the code yourself, you can do so via [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tyreseGill/data-analysis-of-sales/blob/main/main.ipynb) (NOTE: You will need to be signed into a Google account to run).
